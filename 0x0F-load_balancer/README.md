<h1>Load balancer </h1>
<p>In this project, I continued to build up the configuration of the web server issued in project 0x0B. I was issued two additional servers, one to replicate the Nginx configuration of my original server, and another to set up an HAproxy load balancer on to manage both web servers.</p>

<h2>Concets learned : </h2>
<p>Load balancers improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.</p>
