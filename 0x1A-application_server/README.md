<h1>Application Server</h1>
This is the application deployment project for the AirBnB clone project. In this project, I configured Nginx on the web servers provided to me by ALX school to serve a WSGI Flask app running through Gunicorn. Additionally, I set up an Upstart script to keep the application running on server reboots.
