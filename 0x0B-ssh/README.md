<h1>0x0B. SSH</h1>
This is a Secure Shell (SSH) project. The concepts I practiced here are:
1. What is a server
2. Where servers usually live
3. What is SSH
4. How to create an SSH RSA key pair
5. How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
6. The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash
