<h1>Webstack monitoring</h1>
In this project, Webstack monitoring project, I implemented a monitoring software called Datadog to help me monitor my servers. 

###Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:
<ul>
<li>Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected</li>
<li>Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
</li>
</ul>
